Welcome to my Sinatra app Bartendventory App! This application was built to, in the most simplest of forms,
assist a bar or restaurant in keeping track of their liquor inventory. Within this application one would be able to create their own "Cabinet" and either create the liquor that they intend on carrying with par and price included or choose a liquor from a list of already created liquors. The user is able to manage their cabinets and liquors for each particular cabinet accordingly. Each individual liquor is available to be updated as well as the cabinet. The cabinet is shown in multiple ways. Either as a simple list of what is in stock or in table form with liquor par and price included within the table.
