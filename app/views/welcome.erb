      <h2>Welcome to the Bartendventory App</h2>

      <p>
        With this app, you will be able to create/or edit a cabinet that you will be able to fill from a list of liquors.
        If a particular liquor is not available, you will be able to create a liquor. The main idea is to be able to build an
        inventory sheet for all alcohol in your cabinet. Start by clicking the "Cabinets" tab on the left to create a new cabinet.
